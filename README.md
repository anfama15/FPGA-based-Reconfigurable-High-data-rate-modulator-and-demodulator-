Introduction:
Various devices are used for performing different types of modulations, which can be quite costly and bulky. However, current Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have the potential to perform multiple modulations over the same hardware instead of using multiple devices. In this paper, a reconfigurable cost-effective and compact FPGA-based transceiver architecture with multi-constellation handling capabilities is proposed.

Proposed Solution:
The proposed device has been designed to perform various modulation schemes using a single reconfigurable modulator/demodulator hardware device. It is capable of performing data transceiving at a very high speed of 1 Megabit per second. The architecture is quite flexible, accessible, and compact and could be easily fit-in for a variety of applications including defense sector, telecommunication sector, and other data communication processes.

Modulation Types:
The device is capable of performing multiple modulation types, including Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK), Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK), 8-Phase Shift Keying (8PSK), 16 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (16QAM), 32 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (32QAM), 64 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (64QAM), 128 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (128QAM), and 256 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (256QAM).

Mapper:
A symbol mapper in a digital communication system is used to map the constellations against the digital bits for various modulation schemes to transfer a modulated digital bit stream over an analog communication channel. The mapper takes digital bits as inputs and maps them according to the selected constellation. The coded sequence bits are mapped to constellation points, each of which is typically a complex symbol. The proposed device uses mapper to generate complex symbols for the digital bit stream of the selected modulation type.

Simulation Results:
The simulation results demonstrate the performance of the mapper and demapper in terms of symbols mapping and generating Log-Likelihood Ratios (LLRs), respectively, for various modulation types. The simulation results are as follows:

Symbols Mapping:
The symbols mapping for each modulation type is shown in the table below.

Modulation Type	No. of Bits	Clock Frequency (MHz)	Clock Speed (Nano sec)	Modulated Symbols Mapped/Sec
BPSK	1	50	20	25,000,000
QPSK	2	50	20	16,666,666
8PSK	3	50	20	12,500,000
16QAM	4	50	20	10,000,000
32QAM	5	50	20	8,333,333
64QAM	6	50	20	7,142,857
128QAM	7	50	20	6,250,000
256QAM	8	50	20	5,555,555
Demapper:
A symbol demapper in a digital communication system is used to demap the received constellations that traveled through an analog communication channel for the selected modulation scheme. The demapper converts the constellation points, which are comprised of complex symbols, back to digital bits. The proposed device uses demapper to convert received constellation points back to digital bits.

LLR's Generated:
The LLRs generated by the demapper for each modulation type are shown in the table below.
